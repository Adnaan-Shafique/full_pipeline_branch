"""The demo's question registry - each question owns its own prompt pair.

There is deliberately no single global system prompt. "Is a warning sign
present" is a presence/legibility judgement; "is this antenna open to the sky"
is a spatial-occlusion judgement about the scene ABOVE the object. One generic
persona does both worse than two specific ones, so swapping the dropdown swaps
the entire prompt pair with it.

Adding a third question tomorrow = adding one Question entry below. No other
file changes.

The prompt text lives here as plain string constants rather than scattered
f-strings so a non-engineer can tune wording between rehearsals without reading
pipeline code.

Pure stdlib - importable and testable with nothing installed.
