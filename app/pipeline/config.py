"""PipelineConfig - every path, threshold and flag the demo pipeline reads.

Why the root is defined here and nowhere else
---------------------------------------------
app/detection_demo/inference.py and app/detection_demo/model_registry.py both do

    PROJECT_ROOT = Path(__file__).resolve().parents[2]

which silently points somewhere wrong the moment either file moves. This module
resolves the root once, from a known anchor, and every pipeline stage takes it
from the config object rather than recomputing it. Override `project_root` on
the config to run against a different checkout without editing code.

Pure stdlib - no cv2, torch or gradio - so it can be imported and asserted
against on any machine.
