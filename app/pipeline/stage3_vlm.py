"""Stage 3 - VLM question answering against gpu_api_server_v6.

Self-contained rather than importing from vlm_test_client_v2.py: that client
does not run on the demo host, so there is nothing to import from. The HTTP
contract is lifted, not shared.

Three things here are load-bearing and easy to get wrong.

REGISTRY BOOTSTRAP. The reference client's _build_payload() reads a module-level
_registry that only _refresh_registry() fills, and defaults an unknown model's
modality to "text". Lift that logic without the bootstrap and EVERY image
request raises "'qwen3-vl' is text-only" - which on stage reads as a broken
server rather than a missing initialisation. build_payload() below refuses to
guess: an empty registry is an error that names the fix.

ARRAYS, NEVER PATHS. The reference client re-opens the original file with PIL
and does not apply EXIF transposition, while quality_check.load_image_bgr() does.
A box computed on the transposed array is wrong on the untransposed file. This
module only ever accepts the BGR array the rest of the pipeline is already
holding, so the question cannot arise.

THE SYSTEM PROMPT FAILS SILENTLY. payload["system"] is only set when non-empty,
and both of the server's prompt builders guard on `if system:`. A blank system
prompt produces an unframed answer that looks like a model-quality problem.
ask() asserts it is non-empty before sending, and debug_prompt() lets you verify
it actually lands in the templated prompt.

TWO TRANSPORTS, ONE GPU. A host that cannot see the GPU box reaches it through
llm_proxy_v3 instead, which serves /v1/infer rather than /infer and wants an
X-API-Key header. Every path difference lives in ENDPOINTS below; nothing else
in this module knows which route is in use. Setting gpu_url to the proxy while
leaving transport on "direct" is the failure to expect, and it presents as a
404 - describe_error() says so in as many words rather than leaving it to look
like a dead server.
