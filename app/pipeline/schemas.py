"""Data contracts passed between pipeline stages.

Pure stdlib on purpose - importing this module must never pull in cv2, torch,
onnxruntime or gradio, so the orchestrator's shapes can be unit-tested on a
machine with none of the heavy dependencies installed.

Two fields here are NOT in the original integration plan and are load-bearing:

  QualityStageResult.resolution_ok
  QualityStageResult.ignore_resolution_used
      quality_check.assess_quality() computes
          passed = resolution_ok and score >= threshold
      so an image can score 82 against a threshold of 65 and still FAIL, purely
      on the resolution floor. Without these fields the UI renders
      "FAIL 82.1 / 65", which reads to an audience as a scoring bug rather than
      a resolution rejection. See .fail_kind below.
