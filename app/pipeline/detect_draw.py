"""Shared box drawing for both detector backends.

The real path draws boxes via Ultralytics' results.plot() or YOLOX's visual();
the stub has to produce output a demo audience cannot tell apart, so both go
through this one function. If the visual language diverges, the stub starts
looking like a different system - which is exactly the impression to avoid.
