# Running the trained YOLOX-S detector

Two versions now exist. They differ in **one leg**:

| | `app/demo_dash.py` | `app/demo_dash_yolox.py` |
|---|---|---|
| Port | 7870 | 7871 |
| Stage 2 | human annotation `.txt` sidecars | trained YOLOX-S checkpoint |
| Needs | — | torch, torchvision, `yolox/models`, `best_ckpt.pth` |
| Status | frozen (see `FROZEN.md`) | new |

Different ports on purpose — run both, show either.

## 1. Copy in the missing YOLOX network definition

`app/vendor/yolox/` has the utils. **`yolox/models/` is missing** and has to
come from a working checkout:

```bash
rm -rf app/vendor/yolox/models   # scp nests if the target already exists
scp -r admin@10.66.98.137:/data01/sds_field/Field_Ops/src/YOLOX/yolox/models \
    app/vendor/yolox/models
rm -rf app/vendor/yolox/models/__pycache__
```

The source and the checkpoint live on AISERVER (10.66.98.137); the demo runs on
FALCONPRD. See `COPY_FROM_AISERVER.md` for both copies in one place.

Expect: `__init__.py`, `build.py`, `darknet.py`, `losses.py`,
`network_blocks.py`, `yolo_fpn.py`, `yolo_head.py`, `yolo_pafpn.py`,
`yolox.py`.

**Why it isn't in the repo.** The field-ops root `.gitignore` contains:

```gitignore
models/
```

Git applies a bare pattern at **any depth**, so it excludes
`src/YOLOX/yolox/models/` along with the checkpoint folder it was written for.
The files are on any machine that has trained; they were simply never tracked.
Worth fixing separately:

```diff
-models/
+/models/
```

## 2. Install torch

```bash
pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
pip install loguru psutil
```

CPU is the right call: YOLOX-S inference costs a fraction of the ~2s the
quality stage already spends per image.

## 3. Check the checkpoint matches

```bash
python tools/inspect_ckpt.py /path/to/best_ckpt.pth
```

Should report `num_classes 2`, stem width 32 (→ width 0.50, "s"), and one
dark2 bottleneck (→ depth 0.33).

## 4. Smoke-test against real photos

```bash
python tools/smoke_yolox.py /data/adnaan/fieldops/demo/photos \
    --ckpt /path/to/best_ckpt.pth --limit 3
```

Then **open the annotated images**. Box position is the one thing no test can
check.

## 5. Run it

```bash
python app/demo_dash_yolox.py        # http://<host>:7871
```

Paste the checkpoint path into the Detector card, press **Load / check model**,
then run as before.

## Settings, and where they came from

Every default is read off the training run's own logged exp table
(`02_train.ipynb`, cell 9) rather than assumed:

| Setting | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `num_classes` | 2 | exp table |
| classes | `GPS Antenna` (0), `Warning sign (HV / RF radiation)` (1) | the run's own `classes.json` |
| `depth` | 0.33 | exp table (yolox_s) |
| `width` | 0.50 | exp table (yolox_s) |
| `act` | silu | exp table |
| `input_size` / `test_size` | **(640, 480)** | exp table — height, width |
| `nmsthre` | 0.65 | `yolox_base.py` default |
| `test_conf` | 0.01 | `yolox_base.py` default (the UI defaults to 0.30 for display) |

### On the non-square input size

`exps/field_ops/yolox_s_field_ops.py` reads `input_size` from
`configs/resolution.yaml`, which `01_data_prep.ipynb` derives from the ingested
pool's median aspect ratio. Portrait phone photos at ~0.75 produce (640, 480).

Setting it wrong never raises. On a **portrait** photo the boxes still land
correctly — height limits the scale for both 640×480 and 640×640 — but the
model sees more grey padding and predicts differently. On a **landscape** photo
the rescale ratio itself changes: 1600×1200 scales 0.30 into 640×480 but 0.40
into 640×640, so every box comes out 4/3 too large. The UI exposes the value
under Options for exactly this reason.

### Class order

YOLOX stores no class names in a checkpoint, so they come from the run's own
`classes.json`:

```json
{"nc": 2, "names": ["GPS Antenna", "Warning sign (HV / RF radiation)"]}
```

**Index 0 is GPS Antenna**, index 1 the warning sign — the reverse of the order
originally assumed. The first smoke run caught it: the detector was localising
hazard signs correctly, at 0.89–0.94 confidence, and calling them
`gps_antenna`. Swapping the order does not error; it puts a confident wrong
label on screen *and* into the model prompt as evidence. That is why the order
is read from `classes.json` rather than inferred from output, and why the field
stays editable in the Detector card.

The names are the annotators' own, kept verbatim rather than slugified. Question
matching normalises punctuation and case, so `GPS Antenna`, `gps_antenna` and
`Warning sign (HV / RF radiation)` all resolve to the right question.

## What is NOT vendored, and why

`yolox/data/`, `yolox/evaluators/`, `yolox/core/`, `yolox/exp/`,
`yolox/layers/` — all pull `pycocotools`, dataset loaders and training
machinery that inference never touches.

The `Exp` class is deliberately not reused: it opens `configs/dataset.yaml` and
`configs/resolution.yaml` at construction, both `.gitignore`d, so it raises
`FileNotFoundError` anywhere but the training machine. The two numbers it would
have supplied are pinned in `pipeline/config.py` instead.

The only thing needed from `yolox/data` is `preproc`, copied verbatim into
`pipeline/yolox_runtime.py` with attribution — it must letterbox exactly as
training did.

`mlflow`, `wandb`, `dotenv` and `thop` are imported lazily inside functions, so
none is required.
