"""Sequential per-image orchestration of the three legs.

Sequential is the right shape here, and the timings say so: on the demo host a
quality pass costs ~2.0s per image (u2netp plus two assess_quality runs), the
stub detector is free, and a VLM answer comes back in ~0.35s. Stage 1 is the
bottleneck by roughly 5x, so parallelising the VLM would buy nothing, and a
worker pool would reintroduce the ~20s cold-start the CLI already pays for.

ONE LOAD PER IMAGE. quality_check.load_image_bgr() applies EXIF transposition;
cv2.imread and a bare PIL open do not. Every stage here reuses that single
array, so the quality box, the detection box and the VLM crop are all in the
same frame. Nothing downstream is ever handed a path to re-open.
